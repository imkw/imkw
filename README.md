## Hi, I'm Kay Wang

A non-professional developer who loves coding and coffee. I build small projects to turn ideas into something usable, and I keep learning along the way.

- I enjoy: automation, small tools, web basics
- I value: simple solutions, readable code, steady progress
- Now: learning by building, polishing tiny ideas into practical things
